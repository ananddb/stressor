# This values override the system default, but can be overriden by command line args or run configuration

# Context Parameters used by Activities.
# All used parameters must be listed here in the form:

# Set `null` value to make it mandatory, i.e. must be passed by caller.

# Steps are short sequences of activities and/or steps.
# This section defines some global steps that may be used in suites or other step definitions.
steps:
  # Activities are defined as a list of dicts.
  # The key `activity` matches the class name of a system or custom activity.
  # All other keys are passed to the activity as named args.
  # Since the current context is passed to the activity (in addition to the listed named keys),  activities know about `user`, `base_url`, etc.

  # A step named 'log_in_directly'.
  log_in_directly:
    - activity: BasicAuthLoginActivity

# Suites are sequences of Steps and/or Activities.
# These steps can be
suites:
  # Test-suite 'load_pages'
  load_pages:
    # Suite parameters override the parent context

    # Steps are defined as a list of either
