# Stressor Scenario Definition
# See https://stressor.readthedocs.io/

# File identifier, must be 'stressor#0'
file_version: stressor#0

# The run configuration defines how the `sequences` are executed in parallel
# sessions.
config:
  # Default: name of this config file without '.yaml' extension
  name: Test WebDAV
  tag: Not set (pass `-o tag:TAG_NAME` to override)
  # tag: Test-Run STAGING nightly $(datetime_iso)

  details: |
    This scenario runs some tests against a WebDAV server.
    We use it to test stressor against a locally running WsgiDAV server:
    - Open a terminal and run
      $ wsgidav --root tests/fixtures/ --port 8082 --auth anonymous
    - Open a second terminal and run
      $ stressor run tests/fixtures/test_mock_server

  #: (int) Output verbosity level [0..5]
  verbose: 3
  #: (string)
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8082
  #: (float) Default timeout for web requests
  timeout: 1.0
  #: (int) Max. total error count that is tolerated before stopping
  #: (override with `--max-errors`)
  max_errors: 0
  #: (float) Max. run time in seconds before stopping (override with `--max-time`)
  max_time: 0.0

# Initial context value definitions.
# Context values can be accessed using `$(NAME)` macros, e.g. `$(base_url)`.
# The context is initialized with  all values fron the `config` section,
# but we can add or override values here.
# Set a `null` value to make it mandatory, i.e. must be passed by caller.
