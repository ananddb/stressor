  name: Test WebDAV
  details: |
    This scenario runs some tests against a WebDAV server.
    We use it to test stressor against a locally running WsgiDAV server:
    - Open a terminal and run
      $ wsgidav --root test/fixtures/ --port 8082 --auth anonymous
    - Open a second terminal and run
    $ stressor run test/fixtures/test_mock_server

  # Initial context value definitions.
  # All used parameters must be listed here in the form:
  #   parameter_name: default_value
  # Set `null` value to make it mandatory, i.e. must be passed by caller.
